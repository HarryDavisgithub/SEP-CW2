Welcome to Tinee, a simple text-based Ticket System! It allows users to create tickets to log various issues.

It can be run from command line using:
C:\...\tinee>  java -cp build\classes Client userid localhost 8888 

Where userid is replaced with your user name.
C:\...\tinee> represents the location of the files. This can be changed by using "cd <path to tinee>" in the console.

It also needs a server to run in command line using:
C:\...\tinee> java -cp build\classes sep.tinee.server.Server 8888
